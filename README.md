## Recipe Usage

We highly recommend writing your own wrapper cookbook utilizing the above resources, but this cookbook also ships with legacy recipes that can be used to install sql_server using recipes/attributes.

### default

Includes the `sql_server::client` recipe.

### client

Installs required the SQL Server Native Client and all required dependencies. The SQL Server Native Client contains the SQL Server ODBC driver and the SQL Server OLE DB provider in one native dynamic link library (DLL) supporting applications using native-code APIs (ODBC, OLE DB and ADO) to Microsoft SQL Server. In simple terms these packages should allow any other node to act as a client of a SQL Server instance.

### configure

Configures SQL Server registry keys via attributes, and restart the Engine service if required.

Current supported settings are mostly connection listeners:

- TCP or VIA listener ports
- TCP, Named Pipes, Shared Memory or VIA listener activation.

NOTE: It could be very dangerous to change these settings on a production server!

This recipe is included by the `sql_server::server` recipe, but can be included independently if you setup SQL Server by yourself.

### server

Installs SQL Server 2012 Express, or SQL Server 2016 Express.

By default, the cookbook installs SQL Server 2012 Express. There are two options to install a different version.

NOTE: For this recipe to run you must set the following attributes in an environment, role, or wrapper cookbook.

`node['sql_server']['agent_account_pwd']`<br>
`node['sql_server']['rs_account_pwd']`<br>
`node['sql_server']['sql_account_pwd']`

NOTE: This recipe will request a reboot at the end of the Chef Client run if SQL Server was installed.. If you do not want to reboot after the installation, use the `reboot` resource to cancel the pending reboot.

**Option 1:** From a role, environment, or wrapper cookbook, set `node['sql_server']['version']` to '2012' to install SQL Server 2012 Express, or '2016' to install SQL Server 2016 Express.

**Option 2:** From a role, environment, or wrapper cookbook, set these node attributes to specify the URL, checksum, and name of the package (as it appears in the Windows Registry).

```
node['sql_server']['server']['url']
node['sql_server']['server']['checksum']
node['sql_server']['server']['package_name']
```

The installation is done using the `package` resource and [ConfigurationFile](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd239405.aspx) generated from a `template` resource. The installation is slightly opinionated and does the following:

- Enables [Mixed Mode](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa905171\(v=sql.80\).aspx) (Windows Authentication and SQL Server Authentication) authentication
- sets a static TCP port which is configurable via an attribute, using the `sql_server::configure` recipe.

Installing any of the SQL Server server or client packages in an unattended/automated way requires you to explicitly indicate that you accept the terms of the end user license. The hooks have been added to all recipes to do this via an attribute. Create a role to set the `node['sql_server']['accept_eula']` attribute to 'true'. For example:

```ruby
name "sql_server"
description "SQL Server database master"
run_list(
  "recipe[sql_server::server]"
)
default_attributes(
  "sql_server" => {
    "accept_eula" => true
  }
)
```

Out of the box this recipe installs the Express edition of SQL Server 2012\. If you would like to install the Standard edition create a role as follows:

```ruby
name "sql_server_standard"
description "SQL Server Stadard edition database master"
run_list(
  "recipe[sql_server::server]"
)
default_attributes(
  "sql_server" => {
    "instance_name" => "MSSQLSERVER",
    "product_key" => "YOUR_PRODUCT_KEY_HERE",
    "accept_eula" => true,
    "server" => {
      "url" => "DOWNLOAD_LOCATION_OF_INSTALLATION_PACKAGE",
      "checksum" => "SHA256_OF_INSTALLATION_PACKAGE"
    }
  }
)
```

Depending on your base Windows installation you may also need to open the configured static port in the Windows Firewall. In the name of security we do not do this by default but the follow code should get the job done:

```ruby
# unlock port in firewall
# this should leverage firewall_rule resource
# once COOK-689 is completed
firewall_rule_name = "#{node['sql_server']['instance_name']} Static Port"

execute "open-static-port" do
  command "netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=\"#{firewall_rule_name}\" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=#{node['sql_server']['port']}"
  returns [0,1,42] # *sigh* cmd.exe return codes are wonky
  not_if { SqlServer::Helper.firewall_rule_enabled?(firewall_rule_name) }
end
```

## Installing SQL Server remotely

SQL Server does not support remote installation over WinRM. For example, the installation fails when you run `knife bootstrap windows winrm` or `knife winrm 'chef-client'` with a run-list that includes `server.rb`. However, you can use a scheduled task or run `chef-client` as a service.
